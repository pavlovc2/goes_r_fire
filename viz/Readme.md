# Cesium visualization
This directory contains an html file to run the cesium 3D visualization platform.
To install cesium, see [here](https://cesiumjs.org/tutorials/cesium-up-and-running/).
Once cesium is installed in the desired directory, place the WineCountryFires.html file in the Apps folder. A time-enabled kml file named Fire_Points_n1_utm_buff_time.kml must also be placed in the SampleData subdirectory.
